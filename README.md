# **Let There Be Light Services \- Cross-Platform Application**

This repository contains a React application designed to be embedded within an Android WebView, serving as a cross-platform portal for "Let There Be Light Services." The application features:

* **User Authentication:** Anonymous login for demonstration purposes.  
* **Role-Based Access:** Differentiated dashboards for **Clients**, **Employees**, and **Social Workers**.  
* **Appointment Management:** Clients can request appointments, and Employees can "take" (assign themselves to) appointments.  
* **Benefit Management:** Social Workers can view and update the status of client benefits.  
* **Application Submission Workflow (Simulated):** Clients can initiate requests to submit applications (e.g., to Housing Authorities), upload mock documents, and Social Workers can manage the lifecycle of these application requests, simulating submission and approval/denial.

The application uses **React** for the frontend, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Firebase Firestore** for database management and **Firebase Authentication** for user login.

**Note:** For simplicity, the React app files are assumed to be generated into a react-app/build directory, and then copied into android/app/src/main/assets. In a typical setup, your React app would be a separate project.

## **Features**

* **Role Selection:** Users can dynamically switch between Client, Employee, and Social Worker roles to explore different functionalities.  
* **Dynamic Dashboards:** Content displayed adapts based on the logged-in user's role.  
* **Real-time Data:** Leverages Firestore's real-time listeners for immediate updates to appointments, benefits, and application requests.  
* **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts suitable for mobile devices.

## **Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js  
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
* **Backend (Database & Auth):** Google Firebase (Firestore and Authentication)  
* **Platform:** Android (via WebView)

## **Firebase Setup**

This application relies on Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Authentication for user management.

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**  
   * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
   * Create a new project.  
2. **Enable Firestore Database:**  
   * In your Firebase project, navigate to **Firestore Database**.  
   * Click "Create database" and choose "Start in production mode." You can change security rules later.  
3. **Enable Anonymous Authentication:**  
   * In your Firebase project, navigate to **Authentication**.  
   * Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.  
   * Enable the **"Anonymous"** provider.  
4. **Configure Firebase in Your React App:**  
   * The Canvas environment automatically injects \_\_app\_id, \_\_firebase\_config, and \_\_initial\_auth\_token. When running outside of Canvas, you'll need to manually provide your Firebase configuration object. You can find this in your Firebase project settings (Project overview \-\> Project settings \-\> General \-\> Your apps \-\> Firebase SDK snippet).  
   * Replace the placeholder firebaseConfig and initialAuthToken in App.js if running standalone, or rely on the Canvas injection.  
5. **Set Firestore Security Rules:** It is **crucial** to set up appropriate security rules in your Firebase Firestore to control data access. Go to **Firestore Database** \-\> **Rules** and set them as follows (this allows authenticated users to read/write specific public collections and their own user profiles):  
   `rules_version = '2';`  
   `service cloud.firestore {`  
     `match /databases/{database}/documents {`  
       `// Public data accessible by any authenticated user`  
       `match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/{collection}/{document} {`  
         `allow read, write: if request.auth != null;`  
       `}`

       `// Private user profiles`  
       `match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/profile/{document} {`  
         `allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;`  
       `}`  
     `}`  
   `}`

## **Local Development (React App)**

1. **Clone the Repository:** If this code is part of a larger repository, clone it.  
2. **Navigate to React App Directory:** cd react-app (or wherever your React code is located).  
3. **Install Dependencies:** npm install or yarn install  
4. **Run Development Server:** npm start or yarn start  
   * This will typically open the app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. This is useful for developing and testing the web UI independently.

## **Android Setup (WebView Integration)**

This section details how to get the React application running within an Android Studio project using a WebView.

### **1\. Build Your React App**

Before embedding, you need to create a production build of your React application.

* In your React app directory (react-app/), run:  
  `npm run build`  
  `# OR`  
  `yarn build`  
  This command will create a build/ directory (or dist/ if using Vite) containing the optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### **2\. Create Android Studio Project**

If you haven't already:

* Open **Android Studio**.  
* Select **"New Project"**.  
* Choose the **"Empty Activity"** template.  
* Configure the project (Name, Package name, Save location, Language: Java/Kotlin, Minimum SDK).

### **3\. Add Internet Permission**

* Open app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.  
* Add the following permission **outside** the \<application\> tag, usually at the top level within the \<manifest\> tag:  
  `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`

### **4\. Add WebView to Layout**

* Open app/src/main/res/layout/activity\_main.xml.  
* Replace the default layout content with a WebView:  
  `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>`  
  `<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"`  
      `xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"`  
      `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`  
      `android:layout_width="match_parent"`  
      `android:layout_height="match_parent"`  
      `tools:context=".MainActivity">`

      `<WebView`  
          `android:id="@+id/webview"`  
          `android:layout_width="match_parent"`  
          `android:layout_height="match_parent" />`

  `</RelativeLayout>`

### **5\. Configure WebView in MainActivity.java**

* Open app/src/main/java/com/yourcompany/lettherebelightapp/MainActivity.java.  
* Modify the onCreate method and add necessary imports:  
  `package com.yourcompany.lettherebelightapp; // Ensure this matches your package`

  `import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;`  
  `import android.os.Bundle;`  
  `import android.webkit.WebSettings;`  
  `import android.webkit.WebView;`  
  `import android.webkit.WebViewClient;`

  `public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {`

      `private WebView myWebView;`

      `@Override`  
      `protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {`  
          `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);`  
          `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);`

          `myWebView = findViewById(R.id.webview);`

          `// Enable JavaScript for React apps`  
          `WebSettings webSettings = myWebView.getSettings();`  
          `webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);`  
          `webSettings.setDomStorageEnabled(true); // For React app's local storage needs`  
          `webSettings.setDatabaseEnabled(true);    // For React app's database needs`

          `// Ensure links open within the WebView, not external browser`  
          `myWebView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {`  
              `@Override`  
              `public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {`  
                  `view.loadUrl(url);`  
                  `return true;`  
              `}`  
          `});`

          `// --- Load your React App content ---`  
          `// OPTION A: Load from local assets (recommended for production)`  
          `myWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/index.html");`

          `// OPTION B: Load from a hosted URL (useful for development/quick testing)`  
          `// myWebView.loadUrl("http://10.0.2.2:3000"); // For Android emulator accessing local dev server`  
          `// myWebView.loadUrl("https://your-hosted-app-url.com"); // Replace with your actual URL`  
      `}`

      `// Handle back button presses within the WebView history`  
      `@Override`  
      `public void onBackPressed() {`  
          `if (myWebView.canGoBack()) {`  
              `myWebView.goBack();`  
          `} else {`  
              `super.onBackPressed();`  
          `}`  
      `}`  
  `}`

### **6\. Copy React Build to Android Assets**

* In Android Studio, right-click on app/src/main in the Project pane.  .
* ### **Copy React Build to Android Assets**

* In Android Studio, right-click on app/src/main in the Project pane.  
* Select New \> Directory and name it assets.  
* Copy the **entire contents** of your React app's build/ directory (or dist/) into app/src/main/assets.  
  * Ensure index.html and the static/ (or equivalent) folder are directly inside the assets folder.

## **Running t he Application**

1. **Connect Device or Start Emulator:**  
   * Con**6**nect an Android device to your computer with USB debugging enabled.  
   * OR: In Android Studio, use the Device Manager to create and launch an Android Emulator.  
2. **Run App:**  
   * Click the **"Run app"** (green play icon) button in the Android Studio toolbar.

Your Android application will launch on the selected device or emulator, displaying your React web application within the WebView.

## **Important Notes & Limitations**

* **Simulated Government Integration:** Direct, real-time, programmatic submission of applications to diverse government benefit sites is complex and often requires specific APIs, accreditation, and strict security compliance (e.g., HIPAA). This application **simulates** the document gathering, submission request, and status updates within its internal database. It does not perform actual external API calls to government services.  
* **Document Storage:** The current "document upload" feature only stores **filenames** in Firestore. In a real-world scenario, actual files (especially sensitive client documents) would need to be securely uploaded to and stored in a dedicated cloud storage solution (like Firebase Storage, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), and references to these files would then be stored in your Firestore documents.  
* **Security:** Always consider robust security practices for a production application, especially when dealing with sensitive client data. This includes secure API keys, proper authentication flows, and data encryption.  
* **Deep Linking/Native Integration:** For more advanced native functionality or deep linking (e.g., launching specific parts of your app from external links), you might need more complex WebView setups and communication between JavaScript and native Android code (using JavascriptInterface).  
* **Cross-Platform Frameworks:** While WebView is a quick way to get web content on Android, for truly native cross-platform experiences with better performance and access to device features, consider dedicated frameworks like **React Native** (which is different from React in a WebView), **Flutter**, or **Ionic**.
